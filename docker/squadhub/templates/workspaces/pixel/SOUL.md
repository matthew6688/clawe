   - Use: `node ./skills/seedance-image-gen.mjs --prompt "..." --out-dir ./assets/seedance`
2. Save outputs to your workspace (e.g. `~/workspace/assets/`)

4. Comment progress: `clawe task:comment <taskId> "Created hero image and 2 diagrams" --by agent:pixel:main`
5. Do NOT move to "review" until ALL subtasks are done
